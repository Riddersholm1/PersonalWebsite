## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you’ve found a security issue, **please don’t open a public issue**.

Instead, use the **GitHub Security Advisory** workflow:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab
2. Select **Advisories**
3. Click **Report a vulnerability**
4. Provide as much detail as you can:
   - Description of what you found
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Why you believe it may be a security concern

I’ll review the report and get back to you as soon as possible.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is confirmed, I will:

- Work on a fix promptly
- Acknowledge your help (if you’d like!)
- Release a patch version as needed

I really appreciate responsible disclosure — thank you for helping make the project better. 🙌
